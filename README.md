# HospitalApp-Frontend

The application for managing a hospital has been implemented on the frontend using React. It is based on HTML, JavaScript, and CSS languages,
but also includes certain predefined elements that assist us in styling the web pages.

## Application functionality

In the application, we have multiple types of users such as the administrator, doctor, and patient, providing various functionalities.
The hospital administrator can manage everything happening in the backend of the medical system, including adding, updating, or deleting hospitals, departments, diagnoses, or medications. 
They can also create accounts for doctors to prevent unauthorized users from falsely claiming to be medical professionals. 
Additionally, the administrator can approve or disapprove medications or diagnoses proposed by doctors. 
The application also provides a page with hospital statistics, presenting three graphs related to the most used diagnoses and medications, as well as the trend of appointment numbers based on months of the year. 
This information can provide valuable insights for process improvement and the quality of medical services offered.

Upon authentication, the patient is directed to the main page where they are allowed to view and update their personal data. 
They can also access their consultation history at the hospital and prescriptions with prescribed medications at that time. 
Moreover, to schedule appointments at the hospital, the patient benefits from a simplified process, easily seeing the availability of doctors.

Similarly to the patient, the doctor is directed to their own profile upon logging into their account. 
They can update their profile and add new information.
Additionally, the doctor can suggest new medications or diagnoses if they are not found in the database and are required to prescribe a medical prescription.
The doctor also has the ability to accept or reject appointments made by patients based on their availability. 
Moreover, they can conduct medical consultations and examinations.
All of these functions are essential for ensuring efficient and quality care.
